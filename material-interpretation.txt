RCD Material interpretation (browser display)

The purpose of this document is to interpret the material specifications for use in RCD products.
These specs will focus only on browser display (no plan on native app support, especially since a mid-term goal is to create  PWAs).
It will simplify or skip some specifications (animations, shadows, ...).
TODO: Apply to existing framework: styling but also structure


Environment:
    Thickness: 1px
    Shadow? TBD
Layout
    Units & measurements:
        Replace dp & sp by pixels
