RCD Material interpretation (browser display)

The purpose of this document is to interpret the material specifications for use in RCD products.
These specs will focus only on browser display (no plan on native app support, especially since a mid-term goal is to create  PWAs).
It will simplify or skip some specifications (light theme, no animations, no ink ripples :S, simplified shadows, ...).
TODO: Apply to existing framework: styling but also structure. Styles were applied by component type. Try to make them more generic
TODO: Move icons developped into others projects into a separate repo

Motion
    Duration & easing
        Animation: approx. 200ms (adapation of specs)
        Standard curve: cubic-bezier(0.4, 0.0, 0.2, 1);
        Deceleration curve: cubic-bezier(0.0, 0.0, 0.2, 1);
        Acceleration curve: cubic-bezier(0.4, 0.0, 1, 1);
        Sharp curve: cubic-bezier(0.4, 0.0, 0.6, 1);
    Movement
        Movement on screen -> standard curve
        Entering/Leaving (if not pushing other content) -> dec/acc curve
        Temporary leaving screen  -> sharp curve (For example side nav)
        
Style
    Color: Not a big fan of the color palette. What is advised is to select 3 hues of primary color (500, 700, 800) and 1 accent color.
            I will choose 1 primary (no need for more, no status bar for ex.), 1 accent and no second color
        Primary color (The 500 indigo by default: #3F51B5): Most widely used
        Accent color: Text fields and cursors, Text fields and cursors, Progress bars, Selection controls, buttons, and sliders, links
        Fallback accent: Plan actually the possibiity to have 2 accent colors: on dark and light (For the moment I never needed the on dark)

        Text
            Dark text on light
                Primary: #000 0.87

                Disabled/Hint: #000 0.38
                Dividers: #000 0.12
            Light text on dark
                Primary: #fff 1
