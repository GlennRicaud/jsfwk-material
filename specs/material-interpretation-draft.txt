RCD Material interpretation (browser display)

The purpose of this document is to interpret the material specifications for use in RCD products.
These specs will focus only on browser display (no plan on native app support, especially since a mid-term goal is to create  PWAs).
It will simplify or skip some specifications (light theme, no animations, no ink ripples :S, simplified shadows, ...).
TODO: Create a new version / Adapt-merge existing framework ( -> 2.0.0).
TODO Create demo at the same time in src/test using it and write down how to use framework in readme
TODO: Adapt datatoolbox to new framework
TODO: Move icons developped into others projects into a separate repo

Material design
    Environment:
        Thickness: 1px
    Shadow
        App bar: 4px
        Raised button: 2/8 or 0/2 (resting/pressed)
        Floating button: 6/12 (resting/pressed)
        Card: 2/8 or 0/8 (resting/hover)
        Menu: 8
        Sub menu: 8+1*each_sub_level
        Dialog: 24 (check if overlay mention)
        Nav drawer: 16
        Modal botton sheet: 16
        Refresh indic: 3
        Search: 2/3 (resting/scrolled)
        Snackbar: 6
        Switch 1
Motion
    Duration & easing
        Animation: approx. 200ms (adaptation of specs)
        Standard curve: cubic-bezier(0.4, 0.0, 0.2, 1);
        Deceleration curve: cubic-bezier(0.0, 0.0, 0.2, 1);
        Acceleration curve: cubic-bezier(0.4, 0.0, 1, 1);
        Sharp curve: cubic-bezier(0.4, 0.0, 0.6, 1);
    Movement
        Movement on screen -> standard curve
        Entering/Leaving (if not pushing other content) -> dec/acc curve
        Temporary leaving screen  -> sharp curve (For example side nav)
        
Style
    Color:
        Adaptation
            Not necessarily following color palette even if it is possible
            What is advised is to select 3 hues of primary color (500, 700, 800) and 1 accent color.
            I will choose 1 primary (no need for more (no status bar for ex.)), 1 accent and no second color
        Primary color (The 500 indigo by default: #3F51B5): Most widely used
        Accent color: Text fields and cursors, Progress bars, Selection controls, buttons, and sliders, links
        Fallback accent: None. I will suppose that primary and accent are always dark color and thus text is always white
        => Will not implement dark/night mode for now.

        Text
            Dark text on light
                Primary: #000 0.87
                Sec: #000 0.54
                Disabled/Hint: #000 0.38
                Dividers: #000 0.12
            Light text on dark
                Primary: #fff 1
                Sec: #fff 0.7
                Disabled/Hint: #fff 0.5
                Dividers: #fff 0.12
        Icon
            Dark icon
                Active: 0.54
                Inactive: 0.38
            Light icon
                Active 1
                Inactive 0.5
        Back: The example for background color is: #fafafa (not spec)
    
    Icons
        Product icon: 48px with 1px edge
        System icon: 24px
        TODO: Read product icon specs
        System icon:
            20px and 2px margin on each side
            2px corner radius for silhouette forms. No round corner for strokes or interior corner
            Stroke: 2px and squared end
            Size of icon is 24, but element containing should be 48px
            
            Color (Incoherence with previous part :S !!!)
                Dark
                    Active: 0.54
                    Inactive: 0.26
                Light
                    Active: 1
                    Inactive: 0.3

    Typography
        Typeface: Stack is defined after as: Roboto > Noto > sans-serif. 
                Wont include Noto until more info on OFL. (Actually not present in their stack... one of many incoherences)

            Permanent : Always there. Compress content

                Persistant:  Stays there when content is touched. Compresses content
                Tempo: Is removed when content is touched. Pushes content
        Tempo Overlay: Appears. Over content. Is removed when outside is touched
        
    Units & measurements:
        Replace dp & sp by pixels

Pattern
    Navigation
        Up: Go to parent untill home screen
        Back: Go to previous
        "Make navigation more predictable by inserting the navigation path the user took to the app's topmost screen" -> Already done with breadcrumbs.
        Nav not affected by tab action, swipe, dropdown
        
        => Toolbox: I should maybe pass to tabs instead of nav drawer for the main views. But from what I saw in android apps or examples, they have 2 /3 items: 4 starts to be too much to my taste.
            => Google play has a side nav but tha behaves like a mix of perm and tempo ...
