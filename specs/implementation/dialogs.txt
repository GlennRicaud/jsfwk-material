In my previous project I differentiated 3 kind of dialogs:
    Input/Selection/... dialogs: Ask the user for data. Cancel/Confirm button
    Confirmation dialogs. Not input fields, just a message. Cancel/Confirm button.
    Details: Temporary dialog. Makes the user wait and block any UI action before finishing.
        => I like to put an overlay. First to block actions but also to focus on dialog. 
        On details dialog do not put it since details dialog can be very fast depending on machine and network and cause a blinking effect.
