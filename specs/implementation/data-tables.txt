Data tables

In a card or not
Nav or not


Text
    Content: Reg 13px 0.87 black
    Header: Med 12px 0.54 black
    Sorted header: Med 12px 0.87 black
    Placeholder text: Reg 13px 0.38 black //TODO Editable field
    
    Numeric column: Right aligned
    Text column: Left aligned


Interaction
    Hover: #eee
    Selected: #f5f5f5
    Selected checkbox: Secondary app color (Not accent color like I did)
    
Sort //TODO
    Sort icon: 16px 0.87 container (=> From spec they talk about the icon, not the touch area. How big is supposed to the touch area for 16px icons?)
    Sortable header (hover): Display 16px 0.38 sort icon
    
Edit dialog //TODO
Inline menu //TODO


If table nav and data manipulation tools -> inside a card 
    => Will create a specific table card first and then make it generic
    
    
Table card (header,body,footer)
    Title: Reg 20px 0.87
    Action icon (header/footer): 24px container 0.54 => Same color as other icon, for the size see paragraph below
    Footer labels: Reg 12px 0.54
    Alternate header
        Persistant action: Borderless button
        On selection header
            0.5 of sec color
            Display number of selected items
            May change icons on selection (May be better to void confusion with disabled icons like I did)
            (I suppose that the text color is the same as for a button)

Icons   
    In other chapters, icons are said to be 24px (or 20px if dense) with a container of 48px.
    But here the container is 24px directly on the icon (Checkbox is 18 icon with 24px container).
    => Here, I think I will diverge from specs. THere is no reason to reduce the touch area for most of them. They all seem to have 12px of each side  
        => Adapt checkbox to have an icon of 18px
        => For the case of  rows/page icon, merge it with the text in a common component //TODO Later
        
    

Sizes
    Card header height: 64px
    Footer: 56px
    Data row: 48px
    
    Padding of 24px at left:
        For data row, will be done by checkbox cell
        For title: 24
    24px space between icons
        No need since they already have 12px of touch area on each side
    Padding right 14px
        Header/Footer: icons so, 2 (14 - 12)
    Footer
        Between control set: 20px (32 - 12 of icon)
    Data rows
        Checkbox cell
            left/right padding: 9 (24 - 15)
            width: 66px (48 + 9*2))
            Checkbox icon area
                Left/right padding: 15px
                Icon: 18px
        Column right margin (except last): 56px (last: 24px)
            => Second divergence: 56px is a bit much for mobile display. Will take 24px for all of them ... or finally 24px for all if not desktop
        
        
Alternate table card header
    Specs are not as displayed in screenshots. I will deviate from specs and follow the screenshots.
    Screenshots show a secondary color with 10% opacity (instead of 50% defined in specs. Makes sense. Otherwise the text would not be readable=
    Font-size seems to be 15px
