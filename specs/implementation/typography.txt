In complement to other parts:

Polymer and site of material design do not respect their own specs :S
- App title of specs is Med 20px
- MAterial site is Reg 18px... (seriously?)
- Polymer is Reg 20px
=> Started to use the specs but it does not look good... oh okay, just discovered the antialaising property. Finally not so bad. Will srtick with specs for now

Material site then use
    For page title (section): Reg 34px -> Display 1. Finally some respect
    For sections (articles...) title: Reg 24px -> Headline. Finally some respect
