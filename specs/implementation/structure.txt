NavigationDrawer (nav)
    Follows metrics from lists 
    Icons align at screen left and right margins: 16px
            => padding-left: 4 on mob (16 - 12 of icons),12 on tab/desk (24 - 12)
            => padding-right: 16px on mob, 24 on desk;
    Children
        NavigationDrawerHeader? (header) //TODO Not for now
        NavigationDrawerBody 
        
NavigationDrawerBody
    List item: Roboto Medium, 14sp, 87% #000000
    Subheader: Roboto Medium, 14sp, 54% #000000 //TODO Not for now
    
    
    Icon values: 54% #000000
        => classic, nothing to do here
    Content associated with an icon or avatar left margin: 72px
        => margin-left: 20 (72 - 48 - 4)
    Side nav width: Equal to the screen width minus the height of the action bar
        => 56px for mob, 64 for tablet and desk
        => Will be difficult to implement on web. Thei website does not even care and simple set the width to 256px all the time.
                I will then set it to 256px. Sorry for mobiles with less than 312px
    Maximum width: The maximum width of the nav drawer is 280dp on mobile and 320dp on tablet. 
        => Incoherence again and again: In strucutre mob is define with max: 320px
        => Other incoherence, they tell to multiply standard increment by 5. But for desktop while it should then be 320, it is 400 in structure...
        => Their webpages does not even respect it: THey put it to 256px all the time...
        => I will merge them
            => mob: 280px
            => tab: 320px
            => mob: 400px
    Status bar: 24px //TODO
    Subtitle: 56px //TODO
    Space between content areas: 8px //TODO
    Subtitles and list items: 48px
    
    Item selected
        color: primary color
        Highlight on click (//TODO Ink ripple later)
            If refreshed, the link is only select and not highlighted
            The color is not defined though. 
                Mat design site uses #eee (no transparency, after all they repeated. Always inconsistencies.)
                Their screenshots show a 0xe8e8e8 color. Which would be the same as a #000 with opacity 9% (expl: 0xe8 == 232. 232/255 == 91%)
                    => #000 9% then
                    
Main:
    NAckground color should be #fafafa
