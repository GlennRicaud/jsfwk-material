After replaying with the resizer of Material design and rereading the specs
    The breakpoints are the ones mentionned before: 480, 600, 840, 960, 1280, 1440, and 1600
    The content layout (section here) has a fixed size that adapt on breakpoints as defined before
    The permanent side nav appears only >1440... I think it is a bit too much. Desktop has enough space and want to have a quick navigation.
    
Resizer example:
    =<800px: 360px;
    =<1240px: 760px
    > 1240px: 1160px;
    >=1480px: 1160 (256 -> 1416)

DEVICES (portrait)
    <480px
        iphone5: 320
        s5: 360
        iphone6: 375
        nexus: 412
        iphone6plus: 414
    <840px
        ipad: 768
    =<1240px
        ipad pro: 1024
        

Margins and gutters can be 8, 16, 24, or 40dp wide.
    => But at the same time they use 20 and 40 as margin...
    They recommend 16 as gutter until 600 and 24 over 860
    
They always use 256 of width for permanent side nav...

Incoherence between diagram presented and specs table about column numbers. But also incoherence about tablet max portrait size. Will choose the specs from table since they are more coherent with the breakpoints alreadu used
    <600: 4columns
    >=600 < 840: 8 columns
    >= 840: 12 columns
    
In the table they define the desktop size starting from 1024. 


Hesitated a long time on breakpoints and size of content layout at each breakpoint. But it does not look good to implement an adaptative design.
And anyway it is not specifically defined. It just says to use these breakpoints to adapt. 
It is better to use 100% width - margin until 1600px;
So I will use the breakpoints only for the mobile/tablet/desktop behaviour (and column division).


Final choice!

Margin/gutter:
    < 600: Half margin/gutter 8px (Using half margin will be easier)
    >= 600:Half margin/gutter 12px
    
Mobile: <600
Tablet: >= 600 && <1024
Desktop >= 1024

User the columns system. Using half-gutter size padding -> Solves the gutter/margin problem
Use the column idea. You define the number of column for your component.
A component of 4col will take a 1/3 of width in desk, 1/2 in xxx and 1 on mobile
A component of 6col will take 1/2 in desk, 3/4 in xxx and 1 on mobile
A component of 12col will take 1 in desk, 1 in xxx and 1 on mobile


So to sump up, 2 divisions here
0 <= mobile < 600 <= tablet < 1024 <= desktop
0 <= 4columns < 600 <= 8columns < 840 <= desktop

Go thing with this 840. At 840 we start to have the 12 columns. And at 1024 we display the permanent side nav.
Since permanent  side nav pushes, the content is 768 (1024 - 256), not so far from the 840.
